# AOIS
There will be all lab works in the 4th semester
Now brief plots of all labs:

1 LW: Create a binary calculator (sum,div,mul of binary bumbers). 

2 LW: Create a program that converts original logical formula into PKNF/PDNF. Also code must transform it into binary, decimal and index form.

3 LW: Create a program that minimizes PDNF and PKNF by calculated, calculated-table method, table method.

6 LW: Write a program that creates a hash table. Operations: adding new elements, deleting, printing table, searching by a key, solving collisions.

7 LW: Write a code that creates an associative memory and arranges sorting by a closest up/down and sorting in definite diapason

8 LW: Write a code that creates an associative memory, transform it, arranges searching by 3 bits, sum elements and read words from memory.
